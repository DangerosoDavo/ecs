# ECS Scheduler Detailed Implementation Plan

This plan expands the staged roadmap in `agents.md` with concrete workstreams, task breakdowns, and validation checkpoints. Ownership names are placeholders until the team assigns leads.

## Stage 0 – Foundations & Planning (Week 1)
- **Objectives**
  - Finalize public API sketches and coding conventions.
  - Establish repository layout, CI blueprint, and documentation scaffolding.
- **Workstreams & Tasks**
  - *API Design*: Draft Go interfaces (`Scheduler`, `WorkGroup`, `System`, `World`, `ComponentStorage`). Review with stakeholders; capture decisions in ADR.
  - *Repo Scaffolding*: Initialize `go.mod`, folder structure, Makefile/mage targets (`build`, `test`, `lint`, `bench`). Add basic README.
  - *Tooling Setup*: Define CI pipeline steps (lint, `go test`, `go test -race`, coverage, benchmarks). Create placeholder GitHub Actions workflow or equivalent.
  - *Standards & Docs*: Document coding standards (error handling, logging, generics usage). Add CONTRIBUTING draft and issue/PR templates.
- **Deliverables**: ADR for API, repo skeleton compiling with `go build ./...`, CI plan document, initial docs.
- **Exit Criteria**: Stakeholder sign-off on API draft; automated build succeeds locally; backlog for Stage 1 groomed and estimated.

## Stage 1 – Core MVP Scheduler (Weeks 2–4)
- **Objectives**
  - Implement deterministic single-thread scheduler with deferred command pipeline.
  - Provide minimal observability (basic logging) and core unit tests.
- **Workstreams & Tasks**
  - *Entity & Component Infrastructure*: Build `EntityRegistry` with generation counters, `World` container, base `ComponentStorage` interface, dense storage implementation.
  - *Deferred Commands*: Design command buffers for entity create/destroy and component add/remove; ensure apply/flush stages.
  - *Scheduler Core*: Implement `SchedulerBuilder`, synchronized execution loop, work group registration, execution context, result reporting.
  - *Testing & Samples*: Write unit tests for registry, storage, scheduler ordering; create minimal sample that runs two synchronized groups.
- **Deliverables**: MVP scheduler package, tests passing with coverage report, sample usage documented.
- **Exit Criteria**: `go test ./... -cover` >= 70%; deterministic integration test demonstrates consistent order; logging outputs basic tick info.
- **Dependencies**: Stage 0 API decisions.

## Stage 2 – Async Execution & Safety (Weeks 5–7)
- **Objectives**
  - Introduce async work groups and worker pools without breaking deterministic synchronized path.
  - Enforce component access safety rules and robust error handling.
- **Workstreams & Tasks**
  - *Worker Pool*: Implement goroutine pool with configurable size, queue depth, and instrumentation hooks.
  - *Async Dispatch*: Extend scheduler to submit async groups, handle futures/barriers, integrate with deferred command pipeline.
  - *Access Validation*: Create metadata describing read/write intent; add runtime checks to guard async writes and fall back to sync when required.
  - *Error Policies*: Implement configurable responses (fail-fast, retry, skip) for system errors; ensure metrics/logging capture.
  - *Quality*: Run `go test -race ./...`, add stress harness simulating mixed workloads, expand benchmarks to cover async throughput.
- **Deliverables**: Async-ready scheduler, validation utilities, initial metrics for queue depths, updated documentation.
- **Exit Criteria**: Race detector clean; async benchmarks meet baseline latency/throughput goals; error policy configuration documented with examples.
- **Dependencies**: Stage 1 code base.

## Stage 3 – Observability & Tooling (Weeks 8–9)
- **Objectives**
  - Integrate tracing, profiling, structured logging, and metrics exporters.
  - Provide developer tooling for trace capture and analysis.
- **Workstreams & Tasks**
  - *Tracing*: Implement `RunWithTrace`, `trace.WithRegion` helpers, delta time annotations, async wait time instrumentation.
  - *Profiling & Metrics*: Add optional `profile` build tag enabling `pprof` and `expvar`; expose Prometheus-friendly metrics interface.
  - *Logging*: Create pluggable logging interface with default `log/slog` adapter; ensure logs carry group/system identifiers.
  - *CLI Tooling*: Build `cmd/ecs-trace` sample that runs workloads and captures trace files; document usage alongside `go tool trace` workflow.
  - *Docs & Examples*: Add observability guide, example dashboards, and instructions for enabling tracing in host projects.
- **Deliverables**: Instrumented scheduler, CLI utilities, documentation set.
- **Exit Criteria**: Trace session demonstrates group/system spans; metrics scraped successfully in sample app; docs reviewed and approved.
- **Dependencies**: Stage 2 features.

## Stage 4 – Advanced Storage & Ecosystem (Weeks 10–12)
- **Objectives**
  - Provide multiple component storage backends, snapshot/rollback support, and ecosystem examples.
  - Tune performance and offer reusable plugins to accelerate adoption.
- **Workstreams & Tasks**
  - *Storage Backends*: Implement archetype-based storage and sparse map storage; add generic adapters so systems can iterate efficiently.
  - *Storage Selection API*: Extend `World` to register and switch storage strategies per component type at runtime or via configuration.
  - *Snapshotting*: Design serialization format (initially Go binary/gob) with versioning metadata; implement save/load APIs and integration tests.
  - *Plugin Samples*: Create reference plugins (e.g., physics, AI) showing registration patterns, component definitions, and storage choices.
  - *Performance Tuning*: Expand benchmark suite, add regression tests, profile hot paths, implement targeted optimizations.
- **Deliverables**: Storage module with interchangeable backends, snapshot API, sample plugins, benchmark reports.
- **Exit Criteria**: Benchmarks cover each storage type with documented trade-offs; snapshot round-trip verified; performance targets met or issues logged with mitigation plan.
- **Dependencies**: Stage 3 instrumentation in place for profiling.

## Stage 5 – Hardening & Release (Weeks 13–14)
- **Objectives**
  - Stabilize API, close outstanding issues, prepare v1.0 release.
  - Finalize documentation, migration guidance, and support processes.
- **Workstreams & Tasks**
  - *API Freeze*: Audit public API, address breaking-change risks, add deprecation notices if needed.
  - *Documentation Pass*: Complete API docs, tutorials, examples, and troubleshooting guide; ensure `agents.md` and release notes reflect final state.
  - *QA & Validation*: Run full CI matrix, long-duration soak tests, integrate fuzz tests if applicable.
  - *Release Engineering*: Tag version, build release artifacts (binaries for CLI, published module), prepare change log and upgrade guide.
  - *Support Plan*: Define issue triage rotation, SLA expectations, and roadmap for post-v1 enhancements.
- **Deliverables**: v1.0.0 release candidate, comprehensive documentation, support handbook.
- **Exit Criteria**: Stakeholder approval, release tag pushed, announcement drafted, maintenance backlog prioritized.
- **Dependencies**: Completion of prior stages and resolution of critical bugs.

## Cross-Cutting Activities
- **Risk Management**: Maintain risk register (e.g., serialization format choice, async determinism). Review weekly.
- **Project Tracking**: Use Kanban/Sprint board with stage-labeled swimlanes; burn-up chart for visibility.
- **Quality Gates**: Define minimum coverage thresholds per stage (70%, 80%, 85%), performance budgets, and linting requirements.
- **Communication Cadence**: Weekly status updates, stage kickoff/retrospective meetings, ad-hoc design reviews.

## Glossary
- **Component Storage**: The data layer responsible for holding component instances for each entity (dense, sparse, archetype layouts). Choosing the right storage impacts iteration speed, memory usage, and cache locality.
- **Deferred Command**: A buffered mutation (entity/component change) applied in a controlled phase to preserve data safety across threads.
- **Plugin**: Extension module that registers systems, resources, and storages with the scheduler to tailor behavior for a project.
